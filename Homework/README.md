本部分包含中国科学院大学人工智能专业DSA课程六次课后OJ作业的参考代码

This section contains the reference codes for the six after-class OJ assignments of the DSA course in artificial intelligence at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences

作业难度不高，仅供参考，杜绝抄袭

The difficulty of the assignment is not high, it is for reference only, and plagiarism is eliminated

P.S. 关于第二次作业《乐谱重排》，笔者使用了不完备的贪心算法，由于数据点较水，依然成功通过。事实上要解决完备的问题，需要进行遍历。

P.S. Regarding the second assignment "Score Rearrangement", the author used an incomplete greedy algorithm, but due to the weakness of the data points, it still passed successfully. In fact, to solve a complete problem, traversal is required.
